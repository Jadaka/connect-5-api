Certain eventing requires a duplex communication, so the documentation is organized by the **intent** of the events.

Within each event contains the various data fields that are required / optional. Any field is required unless specified otherwise by a `?` symbol.

When a client initiates an emission, the server will always acknowledge the receiving of that signal with an event name identical to the client emission with `.response` appended to the end of it in case the client must render/complete a task in response.

When a server initiates an emission, the client **must** acknowledge the completion of any client-side changes that must render/complete before the server knows to move on. This is done by emitting an event identical to the server emission with `.response` appended to the end of it.
